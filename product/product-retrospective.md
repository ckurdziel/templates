# Product Team Retrospective
### Ground rules: 
1. Run these retros at least as frequently as your sprint cadence
2. No devices allowed (except if used to write at the beginning of the meeting or if being used by the person running the meeting)
3. Blameless: when we talk about what didn’t go well, we’re not pointing the finger. Strive for an open and honest culture.
4. To leave more time for discussion, spend time up front writing down items for each of the retro categories. This can be done digitally by sending a link out to the team or analog via post it notes. It also gives introverts the ability to gather their thoughts before the meeting.

### Agenda:

First, review status of open action items from the last retro coming into this one. Keep any outstanding ones on the list and remove any that have been completed. 

Outline each of the following and let team members add their feedback for each:

1. What did we do well since the last retro?
2. What should we have done better since the last retro?
3. What did we learn since the last retro?
4. Questions that anyone has? Anything else we should discuss as a team?

Move through each of these categories, talking about each of the items listed. For any items requiring action (usually the questions or the “what could we do better” items), create an action item and document it alongside the retro notes.

After the retro, make sure each action item has an owner and a clear idea of when it will be considered “done” to avoid any confusion during the next retro.

### Templates & Tools in the Retro Process
*The following are some ways you can run a retro using different tools. I have used a variety of these - experiment with new tools and formats as your team needs to!*

1. Create a Trello board with columns for each category of item. Send to the team ahead of time and let them add cards. Turn on voting for these cards and let others on the team +1 cards. Sort each column by the highest votes and review them.
2. Use a Google Drawing and let each member on the team add cards.
3. For a more analog approach, hand out post-its and spend the first few minutes of the meeting having the team write down (or come prepared with them).
