# Templates
These are some templates for documents I often create (or have created in the past). Some are relics of my PM career and some are ongoing ones I use in venture. My goal here is to share these with others and improve upon them over time. If you'd like to see changes to these, I've chosen to put all of them on GitHub for a reason - submit an issue or a pull request with your changes and I'll incorporate them!

## For Investors
