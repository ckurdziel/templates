# Templates
These are some templates for documents I often create (or have created in the past). Some are relics of my PM career and some are ongoing ones I use in venture. My goal here is to share these with others and improve upon them over time.

## For Investors
1. [Deal retrospective template](deal-retrospective.md). To be completed after a company exits or winds down.

## For PMs
1. Product requirements document
