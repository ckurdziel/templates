# User Story Template
_This can be configured as a TextExpander shortcut so it can easily be popped into JIRA, etc. I use `:story:` as the trigger.
It can also be given to an LLM as a way of ensuring consistently generated tickets._

*Pick a title for the user story that succinctly describes the entire behavior. something like: “**Actor does a thing**”*

*In the body of the story, include the following:*
### Motivation
**As a**  \<user persona / actor\>

**I want to** \<do a thing\>

**So that I can** \<reason for doing the thing\>



### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** \<a set of criteria or prerequisite actions\>

**When I** \<perform some set of actions\>

**Then I can** \<see or achieve some expected result\>

### Additional Details
*Bulleted list of specific considerations for the story.*
